Hello!
I was able to do some tasks, but I didn't finish the GraphQL one. I made a very small attempt at the start of the test code but obviously it doesn't work :) 
I left it there since it doesn't affect the rest of the test.
I have never worked with graphQL intercepts but I think I could manage if given another day.
Also in the developer tools the API response is not visible for some reason.
